Tic-Tac-Toe

The game of Tic-Tac-Toe playable in output window!
Written in Python 3.
2 players, hot-seat, 3x3 classic game

How to play:
1) Enter your names
2) Make a turn entering a number from 1 to 9 (don't try to type in any character apart from numbers, the game will crash)
3) Type N to quit the game, type anything else to play another game

Known bugs:
1) 2nd and subsequent games are bugged due to shitty implementation of newGame() function
2) Game crash when entering anything but numbers while making a turn
