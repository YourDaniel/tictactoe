Tic-Tac-Toe

The game of Tic-Tac-Toe playable in output window!
Written in Python 3 with love
2 players, hot-seat, 3x3 classic game

How to play:
1) Enter your names
2) Make a turn entering a number from 1 to 9. Numpad represents a 3 by 3 game board
3) When game is finished type N to quit the game, type anything else to play another game

Known bugs:
1) Try to win really hard because if you tie, the game will stuck in a loop
2) Output window might not be cleared sometimes (depends on where you run the code)

Upcoming features:
1) Carefully drawn ASCII numpad near game board for those losers out there who don't have a numpad

Feel free to commit and request changes! One love!
